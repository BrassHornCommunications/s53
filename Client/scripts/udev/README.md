### UDEV Scripts

Rather than relying on the s53 GoLang daemon to detect if the arduino device
has been unplugged you can use one of the example udev scripts here to detect
the removal and subsequent trigger of a deadhand script.

**** THIS IS A DANGEROUS GAME - UNPLUGGING THE DEVICE WILL WIPE YOUR MACHINE ****
